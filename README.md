# Load CSV to Configurations Script

## Description
Reads a CSV containing simple variations and writes it into Fusion 360 Configurations rows.

## Usage
Clone into your C:\Users\\[YOUR_USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\Autodesk\Autodesk Fusion 360\API\Scripts\Load CSV to Configurations folder.

CSV must have headers. Headers must contain one "Part Number" column. This will set the row name and part number. See Sample Input file.

## Todo
* Split Part Name and Part number up.
* Change to Addin rather than a script with header to column mapping and GUI mapping.

## Done
* Add Insert column type support.
